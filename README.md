# Lightsaber_single_blade_neopixel
This code controls a neopixel lightsaber with an Arduino (I ran it on a nano).  It has on/off effects, and slight pulsing of hue and saturation while on.  It also switches to a party mode using the FastLED library for colorful patterns.

Here is a video I created showing the full build process for this saber (including the hilt): https://youtu.be/Dzpe1GVOJXU
